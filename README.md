# FilmQueryProject

This was my first foray into working with SQL and Java.

# SQL

I find SQL incredibly powerful and now understand why there's an entire industry behind it.  I will say the searches and parameters are usable and easy
to pick up but extremely broad in their grasp.  It reminds me a little about folks who spent a lot of time working on BASH scripting or PERL a long time
ago.  

I very much enjoyed the JOIN command as well as the WHERE and LIKE commands.  I did not capitalize these in my personal code but I do see the benefit of
working them in a text editor command line by command line to make it less confusing.

# Java

I found the Java or at least the (JDBC) stuff more intimidating.  I thought it was interesting that a programmer(s) wrote tools in which I'd have to instantiate
a connection in order to instantiate a statement in order to instantiate a result.  Additionally, the ResultSet is a whole other world of confusion.  Calling
to getNext() automatically moves the iterator forward even if you're just trying to use it as a boolean check.  This caused a lot of frustration as one can imagine.

I feel I still need to work on solidifying more of my code not to crash but this project included so many aspects that just getting the three actual algorithms necessary to conduct this code coupled with the two SQL statements was more than enough work.

In the future, I would like to continue understanding how to create objects that have objects within them and generate lists of those objects (the toughest part of this particular assignment.)
